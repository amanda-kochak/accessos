        <p>Emergency services are not accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing community and they’re not equitable towards people with mental or behavioral health issues.  Traditional 911 emergency services can be particularly dangerous for people at the intersection of these two identities. To address the challenge, our team partnered with accesSOS, a nonprofit organization that aims both to make emergency services accessible to people incapable of calling 911, and to ensure people have alternative options other than 911 for emergency response based on their needs.
          <br>
          <br>
          We set out to learn about the emergency services domain, understand how diverse populations interact with the services, and how we can develop a trusted solution that meets their needs.  Following are some startling findings we uncovered about equity in emergency response in the United States.

          When people think of emergency services in the United States, they think of 911. People call 911 for assistance in the event of a fire, a medical emergency, or a crime. But sometimes, it isn’t possible for someone to verbally interact through a call.  Other times, interaction with 911 really isn’t the right solution for certain types of crises.  accesSOS’ initial design only enabled contacting 911 (medical, fire, and police), but as we dug deeper into the problem space, our perception of the solution evolved.          <br>
          <br>
          People from different cultural and racial backgrounds and with different abilities have different experiences with 911.  Let’s take a moment and explore how experiences may differ based on an individual’s identity.        </p>

      <p>All of these people have different experiences reaching out to or being the subject of a 911 call.  We can’t shape how emergency services respond in a situation.  But we can design a system that ensures equal access to contacting emergency services, and that captures information likely to influence a more appropriate response.  With this mission in mind, we set out to design for the progressive web app for accesSOS.
        <br>
        <br>
        The debate around policing and 911 in the United States is active and robust.  The issues are numerous, particularly in regards to racial inequities and the militarization of police.  As such, we felt it necessary to narrowly focus on specific facets of the problem space. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Our research focused on two primary areas: 
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>Understanding user needs for a solution that enables them to contact both traditional emergency services (police, medical, fire) and mental crisis services.</li>
          <li>Understanding the current emergency services landscape at both social and infrastructural levels to be able to incorporate an app into the existing system. </li>
